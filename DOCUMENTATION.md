## Overview 
  
 This is a REST API built with FastAPI and PostgreSQL. It allows you to perform **CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete)** operations on a **Person** resource.  
  
 API URL: https://crud-app-vcko.onrender.com 
  
 You can create a new resource by making a `POST` request to the `/api` endpoint without adding the `user_id` to the URL.  
  
 By providing the `user_id` and making the corresponding `HTTP` requests, you can update, get and delete a resource. The user_id field accepts both the id of the person and the name. 
  
 You can also get all the resources available in the database by making a `GET` request to the `/api` endpoint 
  
 These **endpoints** are described in more detail below.

 ## Data Validation 
  
 As demonstrated above, the API includes basic validation rules for request data. Ensure your requests follow the specified data format to avoid validation errors. E.g, in the request body, the name field can only accept a `string` data type. 
  
  
 ## API Limitations 
  
 This API has certain limitations that may need to be addressed depending on your project requirements: 
  
 **User Authentication and Authorization**: The API does not use authentication and authorization mechanisms. All users have can access all endpoints. You would need to implement proper authentication and authorization to restrict access based on user roles and permissions.
